- 👋 Hi, I’m @hhwon, a PhD student majoring in computational mechanics.
- 👀 I have a keen interest in new knowledge and a passion for learning new things, in particular programming (Python, Matlab, Javascript, Fortran and C++) and numerical methods in mechanics (FEM, BEM, and meshless methods, etc.).
- 🌱 I am currently working on learning about the mechanics of continuous media, including solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, etc., and writing the corresponding numerical analysis programs (FEM, FBM, EFGM, PCM, MLPG, SPH, etc.).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing the underlying solution algorithm for CAE software.
- 📫 You can contact me by email: huangwang1003@gmail.com
